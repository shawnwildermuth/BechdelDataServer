# Bechdel Data Server Project

This is an example API that exposes a simple API
for retrieving data about Films that were tested
using the Bechdel test for women in film. This 
data set is from [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/#bechdel) and is used via Creative Commons 4.0.

This will be used in several courses and talks
by [Shawn Wildermuth](https://github.com/shawnwildermuth).
